## How to Play

   - Click "New Game" on the menu.
   - Select "Classic Sudoku" (more modes coming soon).

## Tech Stack

- **HTML/CSS:** All interface and styling in a single HTML file, using custom fonts and CSS variables.
- **JavaScript:** Handles game logic, puzzle generation, UI, and Firebase integration.
- **Firebase:** Stores high scores and handles anonymous authentication.
- **Gemini API (Optional):** For AI-powered hints (requires API key).

## Setup & Deployment

1. **Clone or Download the Repo**
2. **Firebase Integration:**  
   - Edit the Firebase config section in the script (`index.html`), or set up your own project.
   - The default setup uses demo credentials and will not save high scores persistently.
3. **AI Hints (Optional):**  
   - Add your Gemini API key in the `getAIHint()` function inside the script.

4. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**

## Customization

- **Super Sudoku Mode:** Currently marked as "WIP" (work in progress).
- **Styling:** Modify the CSS in the `<style>` tag for your own themes.
- **Puzzle Generation:** Tune the number of clues/holes per difficulty in the JS logic.
